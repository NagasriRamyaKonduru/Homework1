What do you think being a data scientist is about?\nA data scientist is a scientist who makes discoveries in mounds and mounds of data and messy numbers.These discoveries can be forecasts, visualizations or just plain math.\n2. What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\n-Data scientists use coding, ML concepts and data wrangling to make sense of the data and the models being used.\n-Statisticians essentially do all this without using coding.\n-You can be statistician without being a data scientist but it is pretty tough to be a data scientist without being a statistician.\n3. How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?\nI see myself more of a data scientist, while I understand the underlying concepts I can only replicate them with the help of the system and handle the models properly only using coding."
